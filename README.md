This model is an AI-powered research writing tool that leverages advanced generative AI models (like Gemini) and real-time search capabilities (TavilySearch) to assist users in generating, researching, and refining academic papers. This model ensures adherence to strict academic formatting and citation standards. Results from TavilySearch are explicitly fed as 'context' to the Gemini model. This process, known as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), 'grounds' the model's output in verifiable external information. This greatly minimizes the common problem of LLMs 'hallucinating' facts or citations, as it has concrete data to draw from.
